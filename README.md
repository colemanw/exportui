This extension replaces the screen used to map fields for exports with a more user friendly one.

Key features are the ability to re-order fields easily (missing from the core version) and
a in-UI display of the how the first few rows of the export will look with the chosen mapping.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).
