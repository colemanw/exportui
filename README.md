# exportui

The new export interface is now part of CiviCRM "core" as of version 5.23. In other words, this extension is now unsupported, since the feature is maintained as part of CiviCRM itself. This repository is archived.

## Usage

When this extension is installed the screen for mapping fields on UI exports will present as the improved
version. No user action is required.
